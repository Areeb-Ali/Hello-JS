<h1>Variables</h1>
<ul>
<li>Variables in JavaScript act as named storage containers for data</li>
<li>Three keywords to declare variables: let, const, var</li>
<li>Variable naming rules: start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign, case-sensitive, cannot use reserved keywords</li>
<li>JavaScript is loosely typed, variable type is determined by the value assigned</li>
<li>Common data types in JavaScript: Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Objects, Arrays, Undefined, Null</li>
<li>Use assignment operator (=) to assign a value to a variable</li>
<li>Variable scope: Block Scope (let and const), Function Scope (var), Global Scope</li>
<li>Best Practices: use meaningful variable names, use let or const for variable declaration, avoid using var, be cautious with global variables, consider using constants (const) for values that shouldn't change</li>
</ul>
<h1>Conditional Statements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Conditional statements in JavaScript control the flow of a program based on certain conditions
</li>
<li>They allow code to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on true or false conditions
</li>
<li>Types of conditional statements in JavaScript include if, else, else if, switch, comparison operators, logical operators, and the ternary operator
</li>
<li>The if statement is the most basic conditional statement in JavaScript
</li>
<li>The else statement is used in conjunction with the if statement to specify an alternative block of code to execute if the if condition is false
</li>
<li>The else if statement is used to create chains of conditional statements to check multiple conditions sequentially
</li>
<li>The switch statement provides a concise way to handle multiple conditions involving the same variable
</li>
<li>Comparison operators such as ==, ===, !=, !==, <, <=, >, and >= are used within conditions to compare values
</li>
<li>Logical operators like &&, ||, and ! are used to combine conditions to create more complex expressions
</li>
<li>The ternary operator provides a concise way to write an if...else statement in a single line
</li>
<li>Best practices include using clear and descriptive conditionals
</li>
<li>Conditional statements should be used with caution
</li>
<li>Examples of conditional statements and operators are provided for better understanding
</li>
</ul>
